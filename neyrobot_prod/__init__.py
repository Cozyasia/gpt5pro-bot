"""Neyro-Bot production package.

V257 removes legacy AI Selfie production monkey-patch bootstraps from package
import. The stable secret_loader owner routes production generation to the
consolidated V257 runtime. The production fidelity overlay enforces camera framing,
bounded latency, universal FullHD face quality, source-expression preservation,
and restart-safe AI Selfie upload state.
